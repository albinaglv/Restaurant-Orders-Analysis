### 📁 Project Overview
Welcome to the **Taste of the World Café** analysis project! This project involves a comprehensive SQL analysis of restaurant orders from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023, using a fictional dataset. The aim is to uncover insights into menu performance and customer preferences following the introduction of a new menu at the beginning of the year. The Taste of the World Café offers a diverse selection of Asian, American, Mexican, and Italian cuisines, providing a unique dining experience that captures flavors from around the world.

### 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Maven Analytics: Data Playground](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=4&pageSize=5). It includes data on menu items, their prices and order information. 
The data is available in CSV format and consists of two files: 
- **menu_items.csv**: This file contains the following columns: `menu_item_id`, `item_name`, `category`, `price.
- **order_details.csv**: This file includes columns such as `order_details_id`, `order_id`, `order_date`, `order_time`, `item_id`.

### Tools Used

- **MySQL**: The primary database management system used for querying and data analysis.

### 🎯 Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Menu Analysis**: Evaluate menu items and pricing structures to determine the most and least popular dishes.
2. **Order Analysis**: Identify purchasing patterns, peak order times, and the distribution of orders across different menu categories.
3. **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Analyse customer preferences, high-spending orders, and trends to inform business decisions.

### SQL Queries

**Example:** Join `order_details` and `menu_items` tables

**Techniques Used:** `LEFT JOIN`
```sql
SELECT * FROM order_details AS od
LEFT JOIN menu_items AS mi
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id;
```
**Explanation:** The LEFT JOIN ensures all records from `order_details` are retained.
 Combining these tables is essential for obtaining a comprehensive view of all orders and their related menu items.
 


**Example:** Identify the least and most expensive dishes in the Italian category. 

**Techniques Used:** CTE, Window function (`DENSE_RANK`)
```sql
 WITH ItalianRankedItems AS (
    SELECT 
        item_name,
        price,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY price) AS price_rank_asc, 
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY price DESC) AS price_rank_desc
    FROM 
        menu_items
    WHERE 
        category = 'Italian'
)
SELECT 
    item_name,
    price
FROM 
    ItalianRankedItems
WHERE 
    price_rank_asc = 1 OR price_rank_desc = 1; 
```
**Explanation**: This query identifies the least and most expensive dishes within the Italian cuisine category using a CTE (`ItalianRankedItems`) to rank menu items by price with `DENSE_RANK()`. By separating the ranking logic into a CTE, the main query focuses solely on selecting items with the lowest and highest ranks (`price_rank_asc = 1` or `price_rank_desc = 1`). This approach ensures clarity, maintains code modularity, and leverages `DENSE_RANK()` to accurately handle ties in pricing, providing valuable insights into pricing dynamics specific to Italian dishes.



**Example:** Counting orders with more Than 12 items

**Techniques Used:** Subquery

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS orders_with_more_than_12_items
FROM (
	SELECT 
	order_id, 
	COUNT(item_id) AS total_items_ordered
	FROM order_details
	GROUP BY order_id
    HAVING COUNT(item_id) > 12
) AS number_of_orders
```
**Explanation**: This query calculates the number of orders that contain more than 12 items. It uses a subquery to first group the `order_details` by `order_id` and counts the total number of items for each order. The `HAVING` clause filters out orders with 12 or fewer items, and only those with more than 12 items are considered. The outer query then counts these filtered orders, giving the total number of orders with more than 12 items. This analysis helps in identifying larger orders, which could be useful for understanding customer purchasing behavior or optimizing inventory management.

### Limitations

**Limited Timeframe:**

The analysis is based on data spanning three months from January to March, which may not capture seasonal variations or long-term trends in customer behavior and menu popularity.

**Lack of Real-World Variability:**

 The dataset used for this project is fictional and may not capture the full complexity and unpredictability of actual restaurant operations. This can limit the applicability of the findings to real-world scenarios.

**Lack of Direct Feedback:**
 
The analysis does not incorporate direct customer feedback or satisfaction metrics, which are crucial for understanding the qualitative aspects of menu performance and customer experience.

**Lack of Detailed Customer Data:**

 The dataset does not provide detailed customer demographics, such as age, gender, or income level, which could offer deeper insights into customer preferences and behavior.
